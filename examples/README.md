 All the notebooks were run on a laptop Intel i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz (up to 3.80GHz) processor.
 
 In case you would like to run the notebooks yourself, you will have to set up the Zeisel 2018 data set. You will need at least 16GB of memory to load the data set. Once you've downloaded the data set, please step through `zeisel_2018.ipynb`, since this generates a pickle file, which can be quickly loaded into memory.

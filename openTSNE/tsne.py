    A partial embedding is created when we take an existing
    :class:`TSNEEmbedding` and embed new samples into the embedding space. It
    differs from the typical embedding in that it is not possible to add new
    samples to a partial embedding and would generally be a bad idea.

    Please see the :ref:`parameter-guide` for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    embedding: np.ndarray
        Initial positions for each data point.

    reference_embedding: TSNEEmbedding
        The embedding into which the new samples are to be added.

    P : array_like
        An :math:`N \\times M` affinity matrix containing the affinities from
        each new data point :math:`n` to each data point in the existing
        embedding :math:`m`.

    learning_rate: Union[str, float]
        The learning rate for t-SNE optimization. When ``learning_rate="auto"``
        the appropriate learning rate is selected according to max(200, N / 12)
        as determined in Belkina et al. (2019), Nature Communications. Note that
        this should *not* be used when adding samples into existing embeddings,
        where the learning rate often needs to be much lower to obtain
        convergence.

    exaggeration: float
        The exaggeration factor is used to increase the attractive forces of
        nearby points, producing more compact clusters.

    momentum: float
        Momentum accounts for gradient directions from previous iterations,
        resulting in faster convergence.

    negative_gradient_method: str
        Specifies the negative gradient approximation method to use. For smaller
        data sets, the Barnes-Hut approximation is appropriate and can be set
        using one of the following aliases: ``bh``, ``BH`` or ``barnes-hut``.
        For larger data sets, the FFT accelerated interpolation method is more
        appropriate and can be set using one of the following aliases: ``fft``,
        ``FFT`` or ``Ã¬nterpolation``.

    theta: float
        This is the trade-off parameter between speed and accuracy of the tree
        approximation method. Typical values range from 0.2 to 0.8. The value 0
        indicates that no approximation is to be made and produces exact results
        also producing longer runtime.

    n_interpolation_points: int
        Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="fft"`` or its other aliases.
        The number of interpolation points to use within each grid cell for
        interpolation based t-SNE. It is highly recommended leaving this value
        at the default 3.

    min_num_intervals: int
        Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="fft"`` or its other aliases.
        The minimum number of grid cells to use, regardless of the
        ``ints_in_interval`` parameter. Higher values provide more accurate
        gradient estimations.

    random_state: Union[int, RandomState]
        The random state parameter follows the convention used in scikit-learn.
        If the value is an int, random_state is the seed used by the random
        number generator. If the value is a RandomState instance, then it will
        be used as the random number generator. If the value is None, the random
        number generator is the RandomState instance used by `np.random`.

    n_jobs: int
        The number of threads to use while running t-SNE. This follows the
        scikit-learn convention, ``-1`` meaning all processors, ``-2`` meaning
        all but one, etc.

    callbacks: Callable[[int, float, np.ndarray] -> bool]
        Callbacks, which will be run every ``callbacks_every_iters`` iterations.

    callbacks_every_iters: int
        How many iterations should pass between each time the callbacks are
        invoked.

    optimizer: gradient_descent
        Optionally, an existing optimizer can be used for optimization. This is
        useful for keeping momentum gains between different calls to
        :func:`optimize`.

        momentum: float
            Momentum accounts for gradient directions from previous iterations,
            resulting in faster convergence.

        negative_gradient_method: str
            Specifies the negative gradient approximation method to use. For
            smaller data sets, the Barnes-Hut approximation is appropriate and
            can be set using one of the following aliases: ``bh``, ``BH`` or
            ``barnes-hut``. For larger data sets, the FFT accelerated
            interpolation method is more appropriate and can be set using one of
            the following aliases: ``fft``, ``FFT`` or ``Ã¬nterpolation``.

        theta: float
            This is the trade-off parameter between speed and accuracy of the
            tree approximation method. Typical values range from 0.2 to 0.8. The
            value 0 indicates that no approximation is to be made and produces
            exact results also producing longer runtime.

        n_interpolation_points: int
            Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="fft"`` or its other
            aliases. The number of interpolation points to use within each grid
            cell for interpolation based t-SNE. It is highly recommended leaving
            this value at the default 3.

        min_num_intervals: int
            Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="fft"`` or its other
            aliases. The minimum number of grid cells to use, regardless of the
            ``ints_in_interval`` parameter. Higher values provide more accurate
            gradient estimations.

        inplace: bool
            Whether or not to create a copy of the embedding or to perform
            updates inplace.

        propagate_exception: bool
            The optimization process can be interrupted using callbacks. This
            flag indicates whether we should propagate that exception or to
            simply stop optimization and return the resulting embedding.

        max_grad_norm: float
            Maximum gradient norm. If the norm exceeds this value, it will be
            clipped. This is most beneficial when adding points into an existing
            embedding and the new points overlap with the reference points,
            leading to large gradients. This can make points "shoot off" from
            the embedding, causing the interpolation method to compute a very
            large grid, and leads to worse results.

        random_state: Union[int, RandomState]
            The random state parameter follows the convention used in
            scikit-learn. If the value is an int, random_state is the seed used
            by the random number generator. If the value is a RandomState
            instance, then it will be used as the random number generator. If
            the value is None, the random number generator is the RandomState
            instance used by `np.random`.

        n_jobs: int
            The number of threads to use while running t-SNE. This follows the
            scikit-learn convention, ``-1`` meaning all processors, ``-2``
            meaning all but one, etc.

        callbacks: Callable[[int, float, np.ndarray] -> bool]
            Callbacks, which will be run every ``callbacks_every_iters``
            iterations.

        callbacks_every_iters: int
            How many iterations should pass between each time the callbacks are
            invoked.

        Returns
        -------
        TSNEEmbedding
            An optimized t-SNE embedding.

        Raises
        ------
        OptimizationInterrupt
            If a callback stops the optimization and the ``propagate_exception``
            flag is set, then an exception is raised.

        Please see the :ref:`parameter-guide` for more information.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X: np.ndarray
            The data matrix to be added to the existing embedding.

        perplexity: float
            Perplexity can be thought of as the continuous :math:`k` number of
            nearest neighbors, for which t-SNE will attempt to preserve
            distances. However, when transforming, we only consider neighbors in
            the existing embedding i.e. each data point is placed into the
            embedding, independently of other new data points.

        initialization: Union[np.ndarray, str]
            The initial point positions to be used in the embedding space. Can
            be a precomputed numpy array, ``median``, ``weighted`` or
            ``random``. In all cases, ``median`` of ``weighted`` should be
            preferred.

        k: int
            The number of nearest neighbors to consider when initially placing
            the point onto the embedding. This is different from ``perpelxity``
            because perplexity affects optimization while this only affects the
            initial point positions.

        learning_rate: Union[str, float]
            The learning rate for t-SNE optimization. When
            ``learning_rate="auto"`` the appropriate learning rate is selected
            according to max(200, N / 12), as determined in Belkina et al.
            "Automated optimized parameters for t-distributed stochastic
            neighbor embedding improve visualization and analysis of large
            datasets", 2019. Note that this should *not* be used when adding
            samples into existing embeddings, where the learning rate often
            needs to be much lower to obtain convergence.

        early_exaggeration_iter: int
            The number of iterations to run in the *early exaggeration* phase.

        early_exaggeration: float
            The exaggeration factor to use during the *early exaggeration* phase.
            Typical values range from 12 to 32.

        n_iter: int
            The number of iterations to run in the normal optimization regime.

        exaggeration: float
            The exaggeration factor to use during the normal optimization phase.
            This can be used to form more densely packed clusters and is useful
            for large data sets.

        initial_momentum: float
            The momentum to use during the *early exaggeration* phase.

        final_momentum: float
            The momentum to use during the normal optimization phase.

        max_grad_norm: float
            Maximum gradient norm. If the norm exceeds this value, it will be
            clipped. This is most beneficial when adding points into an existing

class TSNE(BaseEstimator):
    """t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding.

    Please see the :ref:`parameter-guide` for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components: int
        The dimension of the embedding space. This deafults to 2 for easy
        visualization, but sometimes 1 is used for t-SNE heatmaps. t-SNE is
        not designed to embed into higher dimension and please note that
        acceleration schemes break down and are not fully implemented.

    perplexity: float
        Perplexity can be thought of as the continuous :math:`k` number of
        nearest neighbors, for which t-SNE will attempt to preserve distances.

    learning_rate: Union[str, float]
        The learning rate for t-SNE optimization. When ``learning_rate="auto"``
        the appropriate learning rate is selected according to max(200, N / 12),
        as determined in Belkina et al. "Automated optimized parameters for
        T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding improve visualization and
        analysis of large datasets", 2019.

    early_exaggeration_iter: int
        The number of iterations to run in the *early exaggeration* phase.

    early_exaggeration: float
        The exaggeration factor to use during the *early exaggeration* phase.
        Typical values range from 12 to 32.

    n_iter: int
        The number of iterations to run in the normal optimization regime.

    exaggeration: float
        The exaggeration factor to use during the normal optimization phase.
        This can be used to form more densely packed clusters and is useful
        for large data sets.

    dof: float
        Degrees of freedom as described in Kobak et al. "Heavy-tailed kernels
        reveal a finer cluster structure in t-SNE visualisations", 2019.

    theta: float
        Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="bh"`` or its other aliases.
        This is the trade-off parameter between speed and accuracy of the tree
        approximation method. Typical values range from 0.2 to 0.8. The value 0
        indicates that no approximation is to be made and produces exact results
        also producing longer runtime.

    n_interpolation_points: int
        Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="fft"`` or its other aliases.
        The number of interpolation points to use within each grid cell for
        interpolation based t-SNE. It is highly recommended leaving this value
        at the default 3.

    min_num_intervals: int
        Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="fft"`` or its other aliases.
        The minimum number of grid cells to use, regardless of the
        ``ints_in_interval`` parameter. Higher values provide more accurate
        gradient estimations.

    ints_in_interval: float
        Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="fft"`` or its other aliases.
        Indicates how large a grid cell should be e.g. a value of 3 indicates a
        grid side length of 3. Lower values provide more accurate gradient
        estimations.

    initialization: Union[np.ndarray, str]
        The initial point positions to be used in the embedding space. Can be a
        precomputed numpy array, ``pca``, ``spectral`` or ``random``. Please
        note that when passing in a precomputed positions, it is highly
        recommended that the point positions have small variance
        (std(Y) < 0.0001), otherwise you may get poor embeddings.

    metric: Union[str, Callable]
        The metric to be used to compute affinities between points in the
        original space.

    metric_params: dict
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    initial_momentum: float
        The momentum to use during the *early exaggeration* phase.

    final_momentum: float
        The momentum to use during the normal optimization phase.

    max_grad_norm: float
        Maximum gradient norm. If the norm exceeds this value, it will be
        clipped. This is most beneficial when adding points into an existing
        embedding and the new points overlap with the reference points,
        leading to large gradients. This can make points "shoot off" from
        the embedding, causing the interpolation method to compute a very
        large grid, and leads to worse results.

    n_jobs: int
        The number of threads to use while running t-SNE. This follows the
        scikit-learn convention, ``-1`` meaning all processors, ``-2`` meaning
        all but one, etc.

    neighbors: str
        Specifies the nearest neighbor method to use. Can be ``exact``, ``annoy``,
        ``pynndescent``, ``approx``, or ``auto`` (default). ``approx`` uses Annoy
        if the input data matrix is not a sparse object and if Annoy supports
        the given metric. Otherwise it uses Pynndescent. ``auto`` uses exact
        nearest neighbors for N<1000 and the same heuristic as ``approx`` for N>=1000.

    negative_gradient_method: str
        Specifies the negative gradient approximation method to use. For smaller
        data sets, the Barnes-Hut approximation is appropriate and can be set
        using one of the following aliases: ``bh``, ``BH`` or ``barnes-hut``.
        For larger data sets, the FFT accelerated interpolation method is more
        appropriate and can be set using one of the following aliases: ``fft``,
        ``FFT`` or ``Ã¬nterpolation``.

    callbacks: Union[Callable, List[Callable]]
        Callbacks, which will be run every ``callbacks_every_iters`` iterations.

    callbacks_every_iters: int
        How many iterations should pass between each time the callbacks are
        invoked.

    random_state: Union[int, RandomState]
        If the value is an int, random_state is the seed used by the random
        number generator. If the value is a RandomState instance, then it will
        be used as the random number generator. If the value is None, the random
        number generator is the RandomState instance used by `np.random`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        embedding: np.ndarray
            The embedding :math:`Y`.

        P: array_like
            Joint probability matrix :math:`P`.

        n_iter: int
            The number of iterations to run for.

        objective_function: Callable[..., Tuple[float, np.ndarray]]
            A callable that evaluates the error and gradient for the current
            embedding.

        learning_rate: Union[str, float]
            The learning rate for t-SNE optimization. When
            ``learning_rate="auto"`` the appropriate learning rate is selected
            according to max(200, N / 12), as determined in Belkina et al.
            "Automated optimized parameters for t-distributed stochastic
            neighbor embedding improve visualization and analysis of large
            datasets", 2019.

        momentum: float
            Momentum accounts for gradient directions from previous iterations,
            resulting in faster convergence.

        exaggeration: float
            The exaggeration factor is used to increase the attractive forces of
            nearby points, producing more compact clusters.

        dof: float
            Degrees of freedom of the Student's t-distribution.

        min_gain: float
            Minimum individual gain for each parameter.

        max_grad_norm: float
            Maximum gradient norm. If the norm exceeds this value, it will be
            clipped. This is most beneficial when adding points into an existing
            embedding and the new points overlap with the reference points,
            leading to large gradients. This can make points "shoot off" from
            the embedding, causing the interpolation method to compute a very
            large grid, and leads to worse results.

        theta: float
            This is the trade-off parameter between speed and accuracy of the
            tree approximation method. Typical values range from 0.2 to 0.8. The
            value 0 indicates that no approximation is to be made and produces
            exact results also producing longer runtime.

        n_interpolation_points: int
            Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="fft"`` or its other
            aliases. The number of interpolation points to use within each grid
            cell for interpolation based t-SNE. It is highly recommended leaving
            this value at the default 3.

        min_num_intervals: int
            Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="fft"`` or its other
            aliases. The minimum number of grid cells to use, regardless of the
            ``ints_in_interval`` parameter. Higher values provide more accurate
            gradient estimations.

        ints_in_interval: float
            Only used when ``negative_gradient_method="fft"`` or its other
            aliases. Indicates how large a grid cell should be e.g. a value of 3
            indicates a grid side length of 3. Lower values provide more
            accurate gradient estimations.

        reference_embedding: np.ndarray
            If we are adding points to an existing embedding, we have to compute
            the gradients and errors w.r.t. the existing embedding.

        n_jobs: int
            The number of threads to use while running t-SNE. This follows the
            scikit-learn convention, ``-1`` meaning all processors, ``-2``
            meaning all but one, etc.

        use_callbacks: bool

        callbacks: Callable[[int, float, np.ndarray] -> bool]
            Callbacks, which will be run every ``callbacks_every_iters``
            iterations.

        callbacks_every_iters: int
            How many iterations should pass between each time the callbacks are
            invoked.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The KL divergence of the optimized embedding.
        np.ndarray
            The optimized embedding Y.

        Raises
        ------
        OptimizationInterrupt
            If the provided callback interrupts the optimization, this is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: np.ndarray
        The data matrix.

        Perplexity can be thought of as the continuous :math:`k` number of

    method: str
        Specifies the nearest neighbor method to use. Can be ``exact``, ``annoy``,

        if the input data matrix is not a sparse object and if Annoy supports
        the given metric. Otherwise it uses Pynndescent. ``auto`` uses exact
        nearest neighbors for N<1000 and the same heuristic as ``approx`` for N>=1000.

    metric: Union[str, Callable]
        The metric to be used to compute affinities between points in the

    metric_params: dict

    symmetrize: bool
        Symmetrize affinity matrix. Standard t-SNE symmetrizes the interactions

    n_jobs: int

class MultiscaleMixture(Affinities):
    """Calculate affinities using a Gaussian mixture kernel.

    Instead of using a single perplexity to compute the affinities between data
    points, we can use a multiscale Gaussian kernel instead. This allows us to
    incorporate long range interactions.

    Please see the :ref:`parameter-guide` for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: np.ndarray
        The data matrix.

    perplexities: List[float]
        A list of perplexity values, which will be used in the multiscale
        Gaussian kernel. Perplexity can be thought of as the continuous
        :math:`k` number of nearest neighbors, for which t-SNE will attempt to
        preserve distances.

    method: str
        Specifies the nearest neighbor method to use. Can be ``exact``, ``annoy``,
        ``pynndescent``, ``approx``, or ``auto`` (default). ``approx`` uses Annoy
        if the input data matrix is not a sparse object and if Annoy supports
        the given metric. Otherwise it uses Pynndescent. ``auto`` uses exact
        nearest neighbors for N<1000 and the same heuristic as ``approx`` for N>=1000.


    metric: Union[str, Callable]
        The metric to be used to compute affinities between points in the
        original space.

    metric_params: dict
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    symmetrize: bool
        Symmetrize affinity matrix. Standard t-SNE symmetrizes the interactions
        but when embedding new data, symmetrization is not performed.

    n_jobs: int
        The number of threads to use while running t-SNE. This follows the
        scikit-learn convention, ``-1`` meaning all processors, ``-2`` meaning
        all but one, etc.

    random_state: Union[int, RandomState]
        If the value is an int, random_state is the seed used by the random
        number generator. If the value is a RandomState instance, then it will
        be used as the random number generator. If the value is None, the random
        number generator is the RandomState instance used by `np.random`.
